## This project will demonstrate the usage of Spring MVC Form Tags, @ModelAttribute, and storing form data into a 
model attribute, then retrieving that data from the model attribute we created. Display it to our view page.

## We will need to create a student class. Student.java, our student will have 2 variables for
first name, last name. with a no arg default constructor and getters and setters for our variables.

## We will need to create a controller class for our student, StudentController.java and map the controller to 
/student

## create a method in the controller to handle the requests to /student/showForm

## Inside the method we are going to create a Student object, and add that Student object to our model attribute with
the name "studentObj"

## We are going to create a new html view called - studentForm.html where we will take our studentObj attribute that we 
created in our StudentController method. and set data to the variables for our studentObj object.

## We will then create another method that will read data from the studentObj attribute, and bind it to a Student Object
using @ModelAttribute("name of attribute" Object objectvariable), we will then redirect to studentConfirmation 
where we will then read the data created and saved to our studentObj attribute.
