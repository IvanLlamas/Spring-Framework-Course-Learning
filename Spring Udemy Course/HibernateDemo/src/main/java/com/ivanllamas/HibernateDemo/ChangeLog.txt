## In this program we will learn to set up a project and connect to the Hibernate database, since we used Spring
initializr, we will set up the connection to the Database in our application.properties file

## Step 1. Create a Student.java class that will be mapped to our database table "student" in our database using @Entity
and @Table

## Step 2. Create the Variables and map the variables to the columns of our Database in Student.java

## Step 3. We must create a repo interface that will handle CRUD database methods, it will take Student objects
StudentRepo.java

## Step 4. We must create a service class that will handle the CRUD methods from our StudentRepo.java.

## Step 5. We will create a controller that redirects the user to a Student form, where they can add information, and create
a student object. Once they input the student object, we create another controller method that 
takes the student information, and uploads it to the database.

More information on how it works can be found in StudentController.java


Program class functions:
HomeController - takes care of the main menu
StudentController - creates student class from a form using Model, and retrieves user information from the model, 
uploading the data to our database

Student.java - our Entity class, it is mapped to our 'student' table in our database, and the variables are mapped to 
each column within the database.

StudentService.java - takes our Crudrepo interface, and applies its methods to upload Student objects into our database

StudentRepo - our Crud repository, takes Student objects, used for our Service class.
