## This program is expanding on our current state of the program : https://github.com/Ivanhola/Spring-Framework-Course-Learning/tree/master/Spring%20Udemy%20Course/SpringMVC-RegexValidation
We want to make it so our 'freePasses' variable cannot be null when submitting the Customer form,
In order to do that we will need to make the variable @NotNull so that the field is required

## Step 1. add @NotNull to our freePasses variable

## Step 2. Run the program and check if an error message is shown when the user doesn't enter a value

## When running the program we get an error: 
Failed to convert property value of type java.lang.String to required type int for property freePasses; nested exception is java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "" 
--The root cause was that it failed to convert a String -> int 

## Step 3. In order to resolve this issue, we need to refactor our int variable and change it to int->Integer

How does this work? If our field is empty or has whitespace, it will be trimmed to null thanks to our StringTrimmerEditor
that we implemented in our initBinding

Integer is a wrapper class in java

## Step 4. Update our getters/setters for our Integer type variable












 

Special note: 
th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('lastName')}" th:errors="*{lastName}"

this basically says, if the fields 'lastName' has errors, it will display the errors in 'lastName'
