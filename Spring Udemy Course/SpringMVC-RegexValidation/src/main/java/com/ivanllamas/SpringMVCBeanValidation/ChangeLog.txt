## This program will demonstrate how to add regex bean validation to our Customer.java class. Using regular experssions
we can add customized Patterns that the user has to follow when inputting information to a given form/input

## Step 1. Just like our previous Validation programs, We will need to go to our Customer.java class, and add a variable
that will apply our Validation rules, in this case we create a String variable and name it 'postalCode' and generate
getters/setters

## Step 2. Add validation rule to our postalCode variable, using Regex we are going to add a @Pattern annotation
with a regex that acceps 5 character/digit combination

## Step 3. Update HTML form customer-form.html to display errors if any are caught by the validation check

## Step 4. Update our confirmation page to display the postal code that the user entered (assuming it passed the check)

Note: remember, the CustomerController.java has a @Valid and BindingResult to check if there are any validation errors
so we do not need to change anything as ANY error will throw an exception and return the user to the form












 

Special note: 
th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('lastName')}" th:errors="*{lastName}"

this basically says, if the fields 'lastName' has errors, it will display the errors in 'lastName'
