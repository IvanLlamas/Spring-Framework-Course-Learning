## In this Program we will create a properties file named: sport.properties

## We will load the properties file in our SportConfig.java class, and add 
    @PropertySource("classpath:sport.properties")

## We will go to our swimcoach class and define 2 variables and inject them with
    @Value annotation to inject the values from the properties file

## We will run the example in SwimJavaConfigDemo.java main class
    adding System.out.println to print out getters from the variables we created

## Changed Coach to SwimCoach in SwimJavaConfigDemo.java, run the program from
Swim Java ConfigDemo.Java for example & output.
