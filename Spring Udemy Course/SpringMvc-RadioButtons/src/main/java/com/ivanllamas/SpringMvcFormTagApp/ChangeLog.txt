## This program will demonstrate the form tag usage of Radio buttons in spring MVC

## We will need to create a variable in our Student class: favoriteLanguage, to store the data from the radio buttons.
create getters and setters for our variable

## We will need to add inputs to our StudentForm.html for radio buttons, and use ${'StringValue'} and add that data 
to a variable in our Student Object. (favoriteLanguage)


## read the data in studentConfirmation.html by using th:text="${studentObj.favoriteLanguage}"






Special notes:
th:action="@{processForm}" = this is where our form will redirect when the form is submitted

th:object="${studentObj}" = this is the object for the 'model attribute' we create in our controller, and we can store/read
data by referencing the name of this attribute.

th:field="*{Country}" this is the path to our variable in our object.

th:value="Brazil" = this is our value for our variable

th:text="Brazil" = this is what we see (aka the label) for our value

th:each="countries : ${studentObj.countryOptions}" = foreach (countries in Student.countryOptions) we MUST reference
the student object when we want to check the map value 'studentObj.countryOptions' refers to the map in our 
'studentObj' attribute from our model
