## Step 7. Add support for the @InitBinder and StringTrimmerEditor in CustomerController.java

## Step 8. Create a method that will implement the @InitBinder annotation note: InitBinder methods will always use
WebDataBinder to bind data from the web request to the method. Whenever a request to that controller is called, 
it will run the InitBinder method, and perform things before it goes to the controller methods (a pre-processor)



Special note: 
th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('lastName')}" th:errors="*{lastName}"

this basically says, if the fields 'lastName' has errors, it will display the errors in 'lastName'
