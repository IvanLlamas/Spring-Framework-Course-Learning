## We Will create a HelloWorldController Class

## Once we create our HelloWorldController, we are going to annotate it with @Controller to tell spring it is
   an MVC Controller

## We will then implement 2 Controller methods and annotate them with @RequestMapping to tell spring that 
   when the URL "/showForm" is requested, it handle that request and direct it to whatever our methods return value is
   "helloworld-form".html

## We will need to create the HTML files to display the view, in resources/templates/ we will add 2 files: helloworld-form.html
   & helloworld.html

## Using th:text="${param.studentName}" we can pass the studentName parameter to our helloworld.html
